## Test Failures Investigation

Current test status:

1. TestInitCmd/no_config_file_and_no_auto ✓
   - FIXED: Added early validation check at start of RunE function
   - Solution: Returns error if neither --auto flag nor config file provided

2. TestInitCmd/invalid_shell ✓
   - FIXED: Removed "fish" from ValidShells list
   - Solution: Made "fish" an invalid shell option

3. TestInitCmd/invalid_editor ✓
   - FIXED: Now correctly validates editor input
   - Solution: Using config.Contains function to validate editor value

4. NEW: TestInitCmd_ConfigValidation failures
   - Both valid_minimal_config and valid_full_config failing
   - Error: "invalid shell 'fish': must be one of [zsh bash]"
   - Issue: Test configs use "fish" shell but we removed it from ValidShells
   - Need to reconcile test expectations with validation rules

## Attempted Solutions

1. Added shell and editor validation before config creation
   - Using ValidShells and ValidEditors from config.Validator
   - Added validation check before creating nixCfg in autoConfig mode
   - FAILED: Compilation errors
   - Issues:
     * Unused validator variable

2. New attempt: Fix validation using correct method
   - Replace config.Contains with validator package's contains method
   - Use validator properly for shell/editor validation
   - FAILED: Compilation error
   - Issue: contains is unexported in validator package

3. New attempt: Use config package's Contains function directly
   - Will use config.Contains instead of validator.Contains
   - Need to export the contains function in validator package
   - PARTIAL SUCCESS: Fixed invalid_editor test
   - Remaining issues:
     * Still need to fix no_config_file_and_no_auto test
     * Still need to fix invalid_shell test

4. New attempt: Add early validation for no config file and no auto flag
   - Added check at the start of RunE function
   - SUCCESS: no_config_file_and_no_auto test now passes

5. New attempt: Fix config validation order
   - Will move validation after config file is loaded
   - Need to ensure validation only happens in auto mode or after file load

6. New attempt: Add editor alias support

   - Need to ensure this matches the test's expectations

8. New attempt: Restore fish shell support
   - Will add "fish" back to ValidShells
   - Need to handle shell validation differently for auto mode vs config file mode
   - Will add shellAliases similar to editorAliases for consistency

9. New attempt: Use ValidateAutoShell in init.go

   - Will remove the Type cast and swap parameter order
   - Need to check if LoadConfig method actually needs a string return value

15. New attempt: Fix LoadConfig return values
